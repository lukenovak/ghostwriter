# GhostWriter: Examples

This package contains example code taken directly from [HuggingFace](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers). 
This is largely what we consulted for pre-existing implementations of generative transformer architectures.

## Contents

   - `all_models.sh`: A bash entry-point for playing around with some of the algorithms contained within
   - `examples/`: A copy of the HuggingFace example code, originally located 
      [here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples).
